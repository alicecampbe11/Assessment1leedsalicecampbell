This repository holds all the files for the Agents (1), I/0 (2), Communicating (3), and Animation/Behaviour (saved as A:B model) (4) practicals. 
A breakdown of what is expected from the outcome of each practical is available below. 
Every practical has two files, a model file and an agentframework file. They should be opened together as follows:

1) AGENTS PRACTICAL - agents model.py, and agentframework.py
- The output of this practical is a list of agents, and a graphic detailing the location of each agent. This distance between 2 agents is calculated.

2) IO PRACTICAL  - iO practical model.py, agentframework2.py, intxt, and environmentout.csv
- The output of this practical is a graphic of agents interacting with the imported environment.

3) COMMUNICATIONS PRACTICAL - commmunications model.py, agentframework3.py, intxt
- The output of this practical is a graphic showing the agents interacting with each other and the environment, sharing the environment data. 

4) ANIMATIONS AND BEHAVIOUR PRACTICAL - a:b model.py, agentframework4.py, intxt
- The output of this practical is an animated graphic, showing the agents moving, 'nibbling' the data, and stopping after they have consumed a certain amount of data.
