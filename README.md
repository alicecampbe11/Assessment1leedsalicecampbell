# Assessment1leedsalicecampbell

This README file is for Alice Campbell's Assessment 1 for GEOG5995M. To view the repository, follow the link at the bottom of this page.

The repository linked at the end of this site holds all the files for the Agents (1), I/0 (2), Communicating (3), and Animation/Behaviour (saved as A:B model) (4) practicals. 
A breakdown of what is expected from the outcome of each practical is available below. 
Every practical has two files, a model file and an agentframework file. They should be opened together as follows:

1) AGENTS PRACTICAL - agents model.py, and agentframework.py
- The output of this practical is a list of agents, and a graphic detailing the location of each agent. This distance between 2 agents is calculated.

2) IO PRACTICAL  - iO practical model.py, agentframework2.py, intxt, and environmentout.csv
- The output of this practical is a graphic of agents interacting with the imported environment.

3) COMMUNICATIONS PRACTICAL - commmunications model.py, agentframework3.py, intxt
- The output of this practical is a graphic showing the agents interacting with each other and the environment, sharing the environment data. 

4) ANIMATIONS AND BEHAVIOUR PRACTICAL - a:b model.py, agentframework4.py, intxt
- The output of this practical is an animated graphic, showing the agents moving, 'nibbling' the data, and stopping after they have consumed a certain amount of data.
